        <p>Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's land area.
            Its population of over 144 million people speaks Russian as the official language. The country has a rich history and culture, with a vast array of literature, music, art, and architecture.
            Russia is also known for its natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals. However, the country has faced many challenges in recent years, including political and economic instability, tensions with neighboring countries, and human rights concerns. 
            Despite these challenges, Russia remains an important global power, with significant influence in many regions of the world.
